<strong>About:</strong><br>
FoodBah helps users make decisions about food. Through this website, the user is able to see reviews, comments, price, nutritional information, and other related information about a menu item from any restaurant, and easily make a choice on what to order based on the information. This data is crowd-sourced, with users expected to make contributions to this menu item database. Users can also search for food by restaurant, by rating, or by name if they're hungry and looking for something to enjoy.<br><br>
<strong>Quick Start Guide:</strong><br>

<strong>Notes:</strong><br>
